# STM32-B-L475E-IOT01A1

## Purpose
Intention with this github repo is to store/track my learning progress around STM32 microcontrollers. I've worked with many variations and vendors of microcontrollers (ST, Avago/Broadcom, TI, etc) through my electrial career/tinkering, but haven't done a deep dive of the low level embedded coding.

Although my experience has mainly been on the electrical side, I've worked side by side firmware and software engineers in the past to see and understand what and how they work. 

## Development
The platform I'm working with here is the STM32-B-L475E.  

It's a nice development board in that it comes packed with sensors (BLE, 915Mhz, Wifi) and SPI/I2C/UART interfaces.

## Things I'd like to accomplish:
 <ul>
  <li>Send email or http data via push button</li>
  <li>Setup a user input environment where one can ping the device over serial</li>
  <li>Setup BLE support for query of accelerometer/temperature data</li>
</ul>
